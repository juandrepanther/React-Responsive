Has Been Used:

- AOS library
- Three JS
- react-html-parser
- React.memo() and Suspense for re-render only child Components (optimization)
- useEffect with setInterval and clearInterval
- responsive images
- flexbox
- grid
- submit input with key "Enter"
- vanilla CSS animations with keyframes
- media queries
- react-router-dom v6
- created own hook useOnScreen() with useEffect and useState hooks, new IntersectionObserver() for getting status if element is on ViewPort for future animations etc. 
- created lazy images loading with useOnScreen() hook other exported function. It is important, that it works with placeholder and just simply refer to img Component it`s gonna wont work like that. Explore RenderOneImage component and its CSS file for better understanding.
